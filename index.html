                <p>My name is Jacob Fenwick, I grew up in Castalia, OH. When I turned 18 I decided I 
                    wanted a change in my life so I moved to Charlotte, NC. Most of my work career has 
                    been in sales. I'm currently working as a jewelry salesman, but hope to change that soon!
                </p>
                <p>Currently I'm enrolled in a Web Development boot camp, being held by UNCC. I first 
                    got into coding back when I sold internet service. They had a Web Development team 
                    and a few of my friends were on it. The more I talked to them about code the more 
                    I knew that coding was the right path for me.
                </p>
                <p>Some of my hobbies are longboarding, coding, and playing video games. I also enjoy 
                    watching movies, taking my dog to the park, and watching educational videos!
